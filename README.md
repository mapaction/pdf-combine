# pdf-combine
We sometimes have the need to combine multiple PDFs into a single document, there are many online tools that can do this such as:
 
http://mergepdf.com/
http://smallpdf.com
 
and many, many more...
 
The trouble with the online versions (apart from having the need for a internet connection) is that they often limit the number of files and the size of the files, plus the time it takes to upload the original files and down load the combined file.
 
So I have written a quick python script (Attached) that will do the job for us. To use:
 
1. Place all files you want to combine into a single folder.
2. Copy the script into the same folder and double click it to run
3. Enter a output filename (include the .pdf extension)
4. Files will be appended in Alphabetical order and the output will be placed in the same directory.
 
--END--
